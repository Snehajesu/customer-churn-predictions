# Streamlit Data App
This project is an interactive Streamlit application that demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning concepts.
It’s built as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in:

Python

Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Streamlit Deployment

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)

The app allows users to:

✅ Upload their own dataset
✅ Perform data cleaning
✅ View statistical summaries
✅ Generate visual insights
✅ Train & test simple ML models.

# Technologies Used

Python 3.10+
Streamlit – for building the web app
Pandas & NumPy – data processing
Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization
Scikit-learn – ML models
Plotly – interactive graphs
